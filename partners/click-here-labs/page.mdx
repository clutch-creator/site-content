    description: When the Choctaw Nation came to us with the idea for the Choctaw Art Hike at their new resort, Choctaw Landing in Hochatown, Oklahoma, we immediately saw the opportunity to create something truly special. They wanted to celebrate tribal artists and Choctaw heritage in a way that felt immersive, engaging, and modern – something that would stand out and leave a lasting impression on guests. We took that vision and brought it to life through an innovative blend of cultural storytelling and digital technology. Our solution included a lifelike artificial intelligence (AI) avatar of Chief Gary Batton, a mobile website experience that gamified the on-site art tour, and a suite of in-room promotional videos to round it all out. It was a deeply collaborative project, and we’re proud of the result: an experience that blends tradition and tech to honor the culture while enhancing the guest experience.
