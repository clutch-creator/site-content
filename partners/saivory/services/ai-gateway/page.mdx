## Overview

As AI agents begin to reshape how renters search for their next home, PropMatic set out to build a foundation that would allow any property management platform to connect directly with AI assistants. The goal: make rental listings instantly discoverable and actionable inside conversational AI tools such as ChatGPT or Claude — without compromising data security or operational control.

PropMatic’s partnered with early adopters in the multifamily industry to design and deploy a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway, an entirely new layer that bridges property data, availability, pricing, and scheduling with AI-driven experiences.

This project resulted in a complete ecosystem that structures and exposes property data through a secure, AI-to-AI channel — allowing any verified AI agent to recommend, schedule, and manage tours in real time. Beyond a technical milestone, the Gateway represents a new business model: leasing operations that can be automated, measured, and optimized through AI interactions.
