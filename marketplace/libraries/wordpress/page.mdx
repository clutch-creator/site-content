### Overview

The **WordPress Library** in provides a prebuilt integration with the WordPress REST API, making it easy to fetch and use WordPress content inside Clutch projects. It is installed by default in new projects, but can also be manually installed or updated when needed.

#### Purpose

This library enables Clutch users to connect to a WordPress backend and query common types of content—pages, posts, media, menus, taxonomies, users, and more—without needing to write custom API code.

#### Why this library?

Building headless WordPress sites typically requires setting up custom fetch logic and handling complex REST routes. The Clutch WordPress Library streamlines that process by:

- Exposing a set of predefined queries that map to the WordPress REST API.
- Allowing users to quickly bind data to components from a familiar WordPress source.
- Supporting dynamic site building without duplicating content or relying on traditional WordPress themes.
