## Who Is Clutch For?

Clutch is designed for professional web creators:

### **Agencies & Professional Web Designers**
Agencies use Clutch to professionally build front-end experiences for their clients. Web designers visually create agentic and traditional web experiences, connecting their clients' existing backends, CMSs, and services. The agency continues to maintain and update the site in Clutch while clients' content teams continue using their existing tools like WordPress, Drupal, Shopify, or any API/MCP-enabled backend.

### **Developers Who Extend Clutch**
Developers work alongside designers to extend Clutch's capabilities:
- **Code Components**: Create custom React components that designers can visually build with
- **Queries**: Connect Clutch to different backends (or use MCP for no-code connections)
- **Actions**: Build functionality to post data to backends (also available via MCP)
- **Helper Functions**: Format and transform data during binding for better design flexibility

### **The End Result**
Agencies deliver branded, high-performance experiences across all channels—traditional sites, agentic experiences, and AI Apps—all powered by one component library. Clients' marketing teams, content creators, and e-commerce teams continue using their existing backends and tools. These tools can be proprietary pricing/availability systems, WordPress, Shopify—anything with an API or MCP server. Clutch pulls it all together into cohesive experiences while content teams never need to learn a new tool.
