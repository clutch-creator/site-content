# What is Clutch?

Clutch is an expressive visual builder powered by modern tech stack that enables web designers to create AI-powered and traditional web experiences that connect to existing backends and services using MCP. Built on **Next.js** and **React**, Clutch provides visual design tools for professional web designers and developers to build websites, agentic experiences, and AI Apps.

## Why Clutch?

### 🤖 **AI-Native Architecture**

Clutch natively integrates with AI through Model Context Protocol (MCP) and built-in agents:

- **MCP Integration**: Connect to backends, CMSs, and services using Model Context Protocol for data queries and actions
- **Built-in Agents**: Agents generate data and UI using your component library, and support conversational interfaces
- **AI Apps**: Publish projects as MCP servers to embed custom UI into ChatGPT and other AI agents
- **Conversational Interfaces**: Build concierge experiences, conversational commerce, and conversational search within your sites
- **Generative Landing Pages**: Create dynamic, personalized landing pages that adapt per visitor

### 💪 **Infinitely Extensible**

Clutch extends without limitations using standard web development patterns:

- **Standard React Components**: Create code components using normal React patterns—no custom APIs or SDKs required
- **Modern Stack**: Built on Next.js 15+, React 19+, and TypeScript with full ecosystem compatibility
- **Developer Tools**: Add queries (data fetching), actions (data posting), and helper functions (data transformation)
- **npm Ecosystem**: Use any npm package within code components
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Publish as websites, MCP servers for AI Apps, or versioned component libraries

### 🎨 **Professional Design Tools**

Visual design interface with professional-grade controls:

- **Component-Based**: Build with reusable components that maintain brand consistency across websites, agentic experiences, and AI Apps
- **Design Tokens**: CSS variables for colors, typography, spacing, borders, and shadows with light/dark mode support
- **Classes & Sub-Classes**: Organize and reuse styles with class hierarchies
- **Selectors & States**: Visual styling for hover, focus, active, disabled, and custom data-driven states
- **CSS Panel**: Comprehensive visual controls for all CSS properties
- **Composed Components/Variants**: Create component variants and compositions visually

### 🚀 **High Performance by Default**

Next.js foundation delivers optimized sites automatically:

- **Next.js 15+ & React 19+**: Fully dynamic sites using React Server Components and App Router
- **Edge Deployment**: Sites deployed globally on edge networks
- **Automatic Optimization**: Images, fonts, code, and assets optimized at build time
- **Core Web Vitals**: Optimized for LCP, FID, and CLS metrics

## Who Is Clutch For?

### **Agencies**

Agencies use Clutch to build and maintain client front-ends while clients continue using their existing tools:

- **Unified Workflow**: Bring web designers and developers together in one platform with real-time collaboration
- **Client Flexibility**: Connect to clients' existing backends (WordPress, Drupal, Shopify, proprietary systems) via APIs or MCP
- **Maintenance**: Update and maintain sites visually without requiring client teams to learn new tools
- **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Build traditional sites, agentic experiences, and AI Apps from one project using one component library
- **Version Control**: Integrated Git with visual interfaces that designers can understand

### **Web Designers**

Web designers build visually using Clutch's component-based interface:

- **Visual Building**: Drag-and-drop interface with comprehensive design controls (design tokens, classes, selectors, states, CSS panel)
- **Data Binding**: Visually connect data from backends to components without writing code
- **Component Libraries**: Use Clutch UI or custom component libraries created by developers
- **Responsive Design**: Design for desktop, tablet, and mobile with breakpoint-specific controls
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Work simultaneously with other designers and developers

### **Developers**

Developers extend Clutch by creating components, queries, actions, and helper functions:

- **Code Components**: Build React components using standard patterns that designers can then use visually
- **Queries**: Create data fetching functions that connect to any backend or use MCP for no-code connections
- **Actions**: Build functions for posting data or triggering workflows (also available via MCP)
- **Helper Functions**: Write utilities for data transformation and formatting during binding
- **Standard Tools**: Use TypeScript, npm packages, and normal React/Next.js patterns

### **Client Teams**

End clients' marketing, content, and e-commerce teams continue using their existing tools:

- Clients use their familiar CMSs (WordPress, Drupal), e-commerce platforms (Shopify), or proprietary backends
- Content teams don't need to learn Clutch—they manage content in their existing systems
- Clutch pulls data from these systems to build the front-end experience
- Agencies handle Clutch; clients handle their content and data

## What Can You Build?

### **Agentic Web Experiences**

Build AI-powered experiences within your site:

- **Generative Landing Pages**: Dynamic, personalized landing pages that adapt per visitor to improve SEO/SEM
- **Conversational Commerce**: Chat-based shopping interfaces that increase conversions and basket sizes
- **Conversational Search**: Natural language search that helps users find content
- **Concierge Experiences**: AI assistants that guide users through workflows

### **AI Apps**

Publish projects as MCP servers for embedding in AI agents:

- **ChatGPT Apps**: Embed branded UI and tools directly into ChatGPT
- **Agent Experiences**: Build for any AI agent that supports MCP
- **Unified Components**: Same component library across websites and AI Apps

### **Traditional Sites**

Build high-performance traditional websites:

- **Marketing Sites**: Landing pages, campaign sites, corporate websites
- **E-commerce**: Product catalogs, storefronts, checkout flows
- **Content Platforms**: Blogs, documentation, knowledge bases
- **Business Applications**: Customer portals, dashboards, tools

### **Hybrid Projects**

Combine traditional and agentic experiences in one project:

- Traditional marketing site with generative landing pages on specific routes
- E-commerce site with conversational commerce on product pages
- Corporate site with conversational search
- One codebase, one component library, deployed as both website and MCP server

**Output Options**: Deploy as a website, publish as an MCP server for AI Apps, or export as a versioned component library.
