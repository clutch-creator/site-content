# Features

Clutch Creator provides a comprehensive set of features designed to help you build high-performance websites with ease. Whether you're a designer, developer, or content creator, Clutch has the tools you need.

## Visual Builder

### Drag-and-Drop Interface
Build layouts visually by dragging and dropping components onto the canvas. No coding required for basic layouts and designs.

### Real-Time Preview
See your changes instantly as you build. What you see is what you get, with accurate previews across all breakpoints.

### Component Library
Access a rich library of pre-built components:
- Layout components (Container, Grid, Flex)
